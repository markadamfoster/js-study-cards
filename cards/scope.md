What is "scope" in JavaScript? What does "lexical scope" mean?

---

Scope is the rules around the accessibility of variables. If a variable is "in scope", it can be looked up and accessed. Variables that are out of scope cannot be accessed.

Lexical scope means that whether a variable is accessible or not is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored in the code (write-time). This is opposed to dynamic scope, which is based on the code at run-time.
