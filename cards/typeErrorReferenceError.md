What is the difference between a `ReferenceError` and a `TypeError`?

---

A `ReferenceError` occurs when you try to use a variable that doesn't exist at all.

A `TypeError` occurs when the variable exists, but the operation you're trying to perform is not appropriate for the type of value it contains.
